<p>
    As House Republicans’ tax package boosts paychecks across the U.S., economists are keeping their eye on trends in consumer behavior to see the impact of the cuts on spending.
</p>
    <p>But the 0.3 percent drop in sales last month signals that optimism about consumer activity boosted by the tax cuts and increasing jobs may be premature. Many economists say wage growth is necessary for consumer spending to increase.

    <p>The jobs report released earlier this month showed a 2.9 percent increase in average hourly earnings in January. But aggregate incomes are still low and sales growth won’t happen until we see sustained wage gains, said Robert Brusca, chief economist at his Manhattan-based consulting firm, Fact and Opinion Economics.</p>
    <p>“The job market is tightening up but people’s wages aren’t getting much higher,” Brusca said. “Retail sales are having problems because worker incomes aren’t doing as well as people think.”</p>

    <p>The $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by House Republicans is expected to raise disposable income, but there is no guarantee the money will increase spending among households.</p>
    <p>Consumers were expected to ramp up purchases based on an unexpected increase in their paychecks, but such support is temporary, according to Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, a brokerage and investment banking firm.</p>

    <p>“In order to sustain the consumer we have to see organic job and income growth, the lack of which has clearly interrupted consumers’ unfounded optimism,” Piegza said.</p>
    <p>Much of the growth retail sales saw in the fourth quarter was largely attributed to destruction caused by hurricanes and wildfires, Brusca said.</p>
    <p>“Insurance money poured into consumer spending,” he added. “We had a period when sales were elevated because people were buying stuff to replace.”</p>
    <p>Despite previous reports that said sales increased 0.4 percent in December, data was revised to show that figure was virtually unchanged.</p>
    <p>“Growth in retail sales will be hard to get,” Brusca said. “I don’t really see incomes spiking up.”</p>
